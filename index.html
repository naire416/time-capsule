                I was sitting down at a communal table in a coffeehouse with two other women– deep in conversation with one another. I placed my book down gingerly, with a hope that if it were tabled softly enough, I wouldn't be imposing. Naturally, they looked up anyway, and we embraced a silent exchange. (My eyes motioned, 'may I sit?' and theirs returned, 'not a problem.') After sitting, conversation lulled slightly, and I verbally assured them that "I'm a nice neighbor, I promise," and that their conversation didn't bother me. They continued: "Eavesdrop as you please."

                A few months ago, I was waiting for a friend, at a cafe where we decided to catch up. Since it was very cold and windy, I decided to enter the cafe (Devocion). This cafe was super packed as it was a Sunday morning--when a lot of people like to come in and get coffees with their friends or do work, just like myself and my friend. While I was waiting for my friend to arrive, I saw a woman sitting on a sofa (in the cafe) petting a dog that belonged to a man sitting beside her (on the same couch). I didn't mean to eve's drop on the conversation between the woman and the man who owned the dog, but I was astonished to hear her say that she was a malayalee and grew up in Muscat, Oman--both of which I relate to as a malayalee who grew up in Muscat, Oman, myself. There aren't a lot of us in NYC! I was shy, but I went up to her and introduced myself to her. We exchanged some pleasantries; she told me she worked at the bank and I told her I was as student. I then had to leave the cafe abruptly, because my friend decided to relocate our meeting spot.

                I went to a concert alone, because the people I was supposed to go with bailed last minute. I was sort of awkwardly standing in the middle of a lot of people, and was feeling pretty sad. I could not enjoy the music I loved because I felt alone. One guy next to me noticed this and brought me into his friend group and introduced me to each and every one of them. As an introvert, this helped a lot as I was able to enjoy the rest of the concert. He asked me why I was alone and told me that I could be with them the entire time, which I really appreciated.

                This exchange left me feeling emotional and I started to cry seeing this act of kindness, as I was pretty anxious going into the concert. Although I do not talk with him regularly, every time I think of this interaction, I feel the same joy and relief.

                In the subway one time, a girl complimented my hair and asked me what haircut I had. She was going to her hairdresser's appointment and wasn't sure what she wanted but she really liked my hair. I told her it was a shag cut and we got to talking. We clicked really well and realized we were at similar places in our lives, going through breakups and a transition in our journeys. I found out she was Dominican and was 29 years old. It was really wholesome how a compliment on a haircut lead to this conversation. We were in a crowded train and were yapping away, i'm sure people around us thought we had been friends awhile.

                At an Indian café around the upper West side, I was eating alone as a friend had cancelled on our plans. An older woman sitting next to me, who was also eating alone, struck up conversation and I learned so much about her life! She was a divorced immigrant from the UK who had been living alone in New York since the 1970s and volunteering at domestic violence shelters! I talked a little bit about my own political interests and justice reform work. We exchanged contact and have stayed in touch since then!

                Yesterday I was in the open sewing studio working on my looks for my pre-thesis collection. I am constantly worried about what others think of my work so automatically I assumed that everyone in that room was judging me. However, a few of them came up to me some hours later and said that they were obsessing over my look for the past few hours and they really liked it. This validation made me feel so much better about myself and what I was working on and I was grateful to have had that interaction with them.

                This guy came up to me thinking I was some other black guy but I wasn’t who he thought I was and then he decided to turn it into a bit and every time he saw me there he would pretend to mistake me for the other guy. I think he was just lonely and wanted to connect. It was at a local coffee spot, we were both students, and he was weirdly really religious. Like he would make motivational preaching videos in his social medias.

                Honestly 10 outta 10 , even tho the bit he was doing was a bit lame and maybe racist, I thought his intent to connect with another person was charming and I definitely enjoyed seeing him there and think about him at times

            This page is inspired by sociologist Ray Oldenburg's 'The Great Good Place' where Oldenburg discusses <i>third places</i> being integral to the self and the community. This project serves as a time capsule for the endangered third place and the small, seemingly insignificant interactions that make us feel like we belong. Often, the internet had been placed at opposition to third places, however, their relationship is not dichotomous with some virtual spaces becoming third places. Feel free to add your experience to the collection and remember to visit your local third place.
